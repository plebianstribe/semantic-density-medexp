# semantic-density-medexp
This repo will contain the source code for reproducing the experimental results reported in paper: "TINY: Semantic-based Uncertainty Quantification in LLMS: A Case Study on Medical Explanation Generation Task.", which is accepted to ICLR 2025 QUESTION workshop (Arxiv link: to be updated).

Note: this repository is currently forked directly from the main paper, additional commits for the medical explanation datasets and experiments will be added as soon as possible.

## Environment Setup

Below are the step-by-step guideline for setting up the experiment environment:

(a) Use the ```environment_llama2_mistral_mixtral.yml``` file to create an anaconda environment for all the experiments with ```Llama-2-13B```, ```Llama-2-70B```, ```Mistral-7B```, ```Mixtral-8x7B``` and ```Mixtral-8x22B```. 

(b) Replace ```anaconda3/envs/{your_env_name_for_llama2_mistral_mixtral}/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/llama/modeling_llama.py``` with ```modeling_llama2.py``` in folder ```huggingface_replacement``` (change the file name to ```modeling_llama.py```). 

(c) Replace ```anaconda3/envs/{your_env_name_for_llama2_mistral_mixtral}/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/mistral/modeling_mistral.py``` with ```modeling_mistral.py``` in folder ```huggingface_replacement```. 

(d) Replace ```anaconda3/envs/{your_env_name_for_llama2_mistral_mixtral}/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/mixtral/modeling_mixtral.py``` with ```modeling_mixtral.py``` in folder ```huggingface_replacement```. 

(e) Use the ```environment_llama3.yml``` file to create an anaconda environment for all the experiments with ```Llama-3-8B``` and ```Llama-3-70B```. 

(f) Replace ```anaconda3/envs/{your_env_name_for_llama3}/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/llama/modeling_llama.py``` with ```modeling_llama3.py attached``` (change the file name to ```modeling_llama.py```).

## Running Experiments

Please read the detailed step-by-step guideline inside folder ```experiment_code``` to generate the experimental results.
